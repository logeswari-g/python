# **Python Operators**

## **1. Arithmetic Operators**  
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- `+`  Addition
- `-`  Subtraction
- `*`  Multiplication
- `/`  Division (returns float)
- `//` Floor Division (removes decimal)
- `%`  Modulus (returns remainder)
- `**` Exponentiation (power operator)

## **2. Comparison (Relational) Operators**  
Comparison operators compare values and return `True` or `False` based on the condition.

- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

## **3. Logical Operators**  
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and` Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`
- `or` Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`
- `not` Reverses the boolean value (`True` â†’ `False` and vice versa)

## **4. Assignment Operators**  
Assignment operators assign values to variables and can be used to modify values in-place.

- `=` Assign value
- `+=` Add and assign
- `-=` Subtract and assign
- `*=` Multiply and assign
- `/=` Divide and assign
- `//=` Floor divide and assign
- `%=` Modulus and assign
- `**=` Exponent and assign

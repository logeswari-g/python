**Class:**
- Collection of objects
- Contains - Attributes & Methods
- Syntax
  - class ClassName

**Object:**
- Instance of a class
- Object is an entity - State/Attributes, Behavior, Identity
- Syntax:
  - objectname = ClassName()

**Attributes/Variables:**
- Normal variable (Defined outside the class as public variable)
- Class variable (Defined inside the class)
- Instance variable (Defined inside the instance method)

**Methods/Definitions:**
- Normal definition (Method created outside the class)
- Class definition (Method created inside the class)
- Instance definition / Constructor (Method created inside the class for initializing the values to an object)

**__init__ Method** - Similar to constructors in C++ / Java

**Object Oriented Programming:**

**Concepts:**
- Class
- Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

**Uses:**
- Code can be reused
- Code maintainability is easier
- Similar feature of codes are clubbed together. So, readability is high.

**Inheritance is achieved by:**
- Parent / Base class
- Child / Derived class

**Types of Inheritance**
- Single Inheritance (ParentA -> ChildA)
- Multilevel Inheritance (ParentA -> ChildAorParentB -> ChildB)
- Hierarchical Inheritance
  - ParentA -> ChildA
  - ParentA -> ChildB
  - ParentA -> ChildC
- Multiple Inheritance
  - ParentA -> ChildA
  - ParentB -> ChildA

**Polymorphism**

Many Forms

---

**Encapsulation**

**Data Members**

Data members are variables and methods inside a class

**Access Modifiers**
1) **Public** - Data members are accessible from anywhere
2) **Protected** - Data members are accessible only by child class
3) **Private** - Data members are accessible only from same class

**Note:** Underscore(_) is used to determine access modifier

---

**Abstraction**
- Abstract classes are treated as blueprint
- Methods defined in abstract class are abstract methods

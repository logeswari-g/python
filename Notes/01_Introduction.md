## **History and Evolution of Python**
- **1980s:** Python was conceived by **Guido van Rossum** while working at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the Netherlands.  
- **1991:** Python **1.0** was released with basic features like exception handling and core data types (lists, dictionaries).  
- **2000:** Python **2.0** introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection but later became outdated.  
- **2008:** Python **3.0** was released with significant improvements like better Unicode support and enhanced syntax.  
- **Present:** Python continues to evolve with frequent updates, making it one of the most popular languages today.

## **Features of Python**
1. **Simple & Readable** – Python has an English-like syntax, making it easy to learn.  
2. **Interpreted Language** – No need for compilation; Python runs directly via an interpreter.  
3. **Dynamically Typed** – Variables do not require explicit declaration of data types.  
4. **Object-Oriented & Functional** – Supports both programming paradigms.  
5. **Large Standard Library** – Includes built-in modules for file handling, networking, etc.  
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

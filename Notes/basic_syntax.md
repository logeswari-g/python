### **Python Syntax and Indentation**
Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code instead of braces `{}` like in other languages. Proper indentation is crucial, as incorrect indentation leads to errors.

```python
if True:
    print("This is correctly indented")  # Indented block
```

### **Comments in Python**
Comments help in making the code more readable. Python supports:
- **Single-line comments** using `#`
- **Multi-line comments** using triple quotes `'''` or `"""`

```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a multi-line comment
that spans multiple lines
"""
```

# Python OOP Practical Questions

## ✅ 1. Bank Account Class

> Create a `BankAccount` class with the following:
> - Attributes: `account_number`, `balance`
> - Methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `display_balance()`
> 
> Add a constraint so that withdrawal isn’t allowed if balance is insufficient.

---

## ✅ 2. Vehicle Inheritance

> Create a base class `Vehicle` with common attributes like `make`, `model`, and a method `start_engine()`.
> Then create two subclasses: `Car` and `Bike`.
> Each subclass should override the `start_engine()` method with their specific implementation.

---

## ✅ 3. Polymorphism with Shapes

> Design a base class `Shape` with a method `area()`.
> Then create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`, each implementing their own version of `area()`.
> Write a function that takes a list of shapes and prints their areas using polymorphism.

---

## ✅ 4. Encapsulation & Private Variables

> Create a class `Employee` with attributes `name` and a **private** attribute `__salary`.
> Add methods to set and get the salary, but ensure salary cannot be set below a minimum threshold (e.g., ₹10,000).

---

## ✅ 5. Class vs Static vs Instance Methods

> Create a class `MathUtils` with:
> - A **static method** `add(a, b)`
> - A **class method** `description()` that returns a description of the class
> - An **instance method** `multiply(self, a, b)`
> 
> Then show how to call each of them appropriately.

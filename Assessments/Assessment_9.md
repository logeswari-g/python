## **Questions on Exception Handling**

1) Write a Python program that divides two numbers and ensures that the message "Execution completed." is printed using a finally block.

2) Create a function that reads a file and ensures the file is closed properly, even if an error occurs, using finally.

3) Write a script that takes user input, converts it to an integer, and handles ValueError, ensuring the message "Input process finished." is always printed using finally.

4) Implement a program where a database connection is opened and closed properly using a finally block, even if an exception occurs.

5) Write a Python script that attempts to open a non-existent file, catches the FileNotFoundError, and ensures that "Cleaning up resources." is printed using finally.
